											<h3>High-performance Desktop/PC</h3>
											<p>I built a high-performance gaming PC from scratch as a personal project, combining cutting-edge hardware and meticulous attention to detail. Powered by a powerful GPU and multi-core processor, it delivers seamless gameplay and handles demanding tasks effortlessly. I optimized the build for cooling efficiency and aesthetic appeal, featuring custom RGB lighting and a sleek, minimalist design. This project not only deepened my technical skills in hardware assembly and troubleshooting but also fueled my passion for technology and innovation. </p>

										<h3>Terminator</h3>
										<p>Terminator is an old 2nd gen Intel i3 PC that I rebuilt with my brother. The laptop was completely damaged and broken, but the motherboard and display were still functional. The only issue was that it would shut down immediately after turning on because it couldn’t handle modern software and operating systems. After a lot of research and experimentation, we discovered that the processor was overheating due to an insufficient cooling system.
											<section>
												<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Terminator.jpg" /></a>
											</section>
											To solve this, we replaced the original cooler with a salvaged cooler from a damaged induction stove. To power this heavy-duty cooler, we cleverly repurposed the laptop’s 12V battery charging circuit. We removed the original battery because it had swollen into a "spicy pillow" and was no longer safe to use.				
											The laptop’s speakers were water-damaged, so we replaced them with an old 12W audio system that was lying around. Again, we utilized the 12V supply to power the audio system. To house all the components, we built a custom wooden case designed for efficient airflow and organization.
											Despite its age, this PC now runs Windows 11 smoothly (after tweaking the OS to bypass TPM and security checks) and can even handle 4K video playback without any issues—all while keeping temperatures well below 70 degrees Celsius.</p>

										<h3>Pi based OctoPrint for 3D Printer</h3>
										<p>OctoPrint is an open-source web-based interface for controlling and monitoring 3D printers. It allows you to manage your 3D printer remotely through a browser, providing a wide range of features to streamline the printing process. OctoPrint is commonly run on a Raspberry Pi, which acts as a server to connect your 3D printer to your local network or the internet.</p>

											<h3>Raspberry Pi - NAS</h3>
											<p>I taught myself how to build a Raspberry Pi NAS using OpenMediaVault by exploring online guides, forums, and official documentation. </br>I started by researching the hardware requirements, choosing the right Raspberry Pi model, and gathering components like storage drives and a power supply. After setting up the hardware, I installed OpenMediaVault by following step-by-step tutorials and learned how to configure the system through its web interface. I experimented with setting up shared folders, user permissions, and network settings to make the NAS accessible on my home network. Along the way, I relied on online communities like Reddit and YouTube to troubleshoot issues and optimize performance. Now, I have a fully functional, locally hosted NAS that serves as a central hub for all my files, all thanks to self-guided learning and persistence.</p>

										<h3>Home Automation (2017 - Present)</h3>
										<p>Designed and implemented a custom home automation system in 2017, featuring an imported Google Home mini from Germany as the central hub. Integrated Sonoff smart switches into the home’s wiring for seamless control, alongside smart Wi-Fi bulbs equipped with presence detection. Leveraged IFTTT to create tailored home routines and utilized Free Open-Source Software (FOSS) to enable TV automation via Google Home and an Android box. Continuously evolved the setup over the years, incorporating the latest smart home gadgets while maintaining a robust and innovative ecosystem. This project demonstrates my expertise in IoT integration, automation, and adapting emerging technologies for practical use. </p>

										<h3>The Retro Beast</h3>
										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Retro Beast.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										
										<p>Meet my ultimate vintage audio setup, a powerhouse from the early 2000s that’s been brought back to life! At its heart is the Yamaha RX-V420 amplifier, a classic workhorse that’s been meticulously repaired and restored to its former glory. Paired with it are five Panasonic 8-ohm and 6-ohm speakers, combined max output of 800W—yes, you read that right. These old-school warriors have been through it all, but thanks to some love and repairs, they’re still pumping out crisp, room-filling sound like it’s the 90's.
											And then there’s the active subwoofer, a 60W beast that adds the kind of deep, thumping bass that makes you feel the music in your bones. Together, this setup is a nostalgic powerhouse, blending raw power with vintage charm. It’s not just an audio system—it’s a time machine that brings the golden era of sound roaring back to life.
											Whether I’m blasting classic rock, diving into a movie marathon, or just vibing to some lo-fi beats, this setup proves that old-school tech, when given a second chance, can still dominate the modern world.
